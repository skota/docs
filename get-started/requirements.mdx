## Basic
Before using Phoenixjumpstart, ensure that following are installed
- Erlang & Elixir
- Phoenixframework
- postgres


## Install elixir
Go to [elixir lang website](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html). Select your 
OS and follow the instructions and install elixir and erlang.

ALternatetively you could use [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf), to install specific
versions of elixir and erlang. Asdf is a tool similar to nvm.


## Install Phoenixframework
After elixir (and erlang) is installed, visit [Phoenixframework](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/up_and_running.html), follow
the instructions and install Phoenix.


## Postgresql
If you are on MacOs, the quickest and easiest way to get started with postgres is [postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com)
simply download and install the latest version. 

If you are on Windows or Linux, download the specific package installer from [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)


If you prefer a nice GUI tool to interact with postgres, try [postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico2/).
