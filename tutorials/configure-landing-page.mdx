## Landing page
Phoenixjumpstart comes with a prebuilt landing page. This landing page is just a collection of 
plain phoenix components. Phoenixjumpstart comes with marketing text specific to the starter kit.

To change this to reflect your own marketing text, update the functions inside `lib/phoenixjumpstart/static_data`.

This module contains functions that return the following data

- Hero section.
- Pricing tables.
- Features and benefits.
- Faqs.
- Social links in the Footer.


After the markeing text is updated, replace the application logo defined inside navbar function in `lib/phoenixjumpstart_web/components/landing_page_components.ex`. That is it. You are done

### How it works
All components that are part of the landing page are defined in `lib/phoenixjumpstart_web/components/landing_page_components.ex`.

`lib/phoenixjumpstart_web/controllers/home/home_controller.ex` contains the code to extract this marketing data and 
feed it to home page template.

The templates are defined in `lib/phoenixjumpstart_web/controllers/home/home_html/home.html.heex`
